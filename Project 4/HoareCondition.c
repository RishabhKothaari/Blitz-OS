-----------------------------  Condition  ---------------------------------

  behavior Condition
    -- This class is used to implement monitors.  Each monitor will have a
    -- mutex lock and one or more condition variables.  The lock ensures that
    -- only one process at a time may execute code in the monitor.  Within the
    -- monitor code, a thread can execute Wait() and Signal() operations
    -- on the condition variables to make sure certain condions are met.
    --
    -- The condition variables here implement "Mesa-style" semantics, which
    -- means that in the time between a Signal() operation and the awakening
    -- and execution of the corrsponding waiting thread, other threads may
    -- have snuck in and run.  The waiting thread should always re-check the
    -- data to ensure that the condition which was signalled is still true.
    --
    -- This class provides the following methods:
    --    Wait(mutex)
    --         This method assumes the mutex has alreasy been locked.
    --         It unlocks it, and goes to sleep waiting for a signal on
    --         this condition.  When the signal is received, this method
    --         re-awakens, re-locks the mutex, and returns.
    --    Signal(mutex)
    --         If there are any threads waiting on this condition, this
    --         method will wake up the oldest and schedule it to run.
    --         However, since this thread holds the mutex and never unlocks
    --         it, the newly awakened thread will be forced to wait before
    --         it can re-acquire the mutex and resume execution.
    --    Init()
    --         Each condition must be initialized.
